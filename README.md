This Repo is dedicated to understand almost everything about XGBoost. It has the following files. My attempt is to create an environment where everything about xgb is culminated.

File-1- Hyperparameter fine-tuning with XGBoost + Optuna.ipynb. In this my main focus is **Optuna** for **hyperparameter tuning** and XGBoosting for **classication** task.

File-2- XGBoosting with Timeseries Forecasting.ipynb. In this my main focus is **XGBoosting** for **regression** based **Time Series Forcasting** task.
